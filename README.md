In this assignment, you will write a program that will house many internal
functions. Instead of typing everything within main(), you will create functions
with different responsibilities to start ”fracturing” your code. Fracture, in this
case, is not meant to be a negative term. Think of it like this, when there’s
a fracture in something, one must understand how it came to be, isolate said
problem, and work on it without the bias of external factors.
All requirements below will assume a shape of a circle for all calculations.

You will submit a single source file, named fracturing.c, that contains all
required function definitions, and any helper functions you deem necessary.

In the source file you submit, fracturing.c, you must implement the following
functions. You may implement helper functions to make these work, as well,
although that may or may not be necessary for this assignment. Please be
sure the spelling, capitalization, and return types of your functions match these
prototypes exactly.
For a quick reminder, helper functions are simply user defined functions meant
to separate logic into new functions. They do not have to follow the restrictions
of the required functions. Example: have a function to print and a function to
read user input
As for user input, you can ask once (so using two points throughout the program’s lifetime) or re-ask (so 5 sets of points). It is up to you how you want to
implement this (just make sure to not change the required function definitions).
Each set of points represent the diameter.

The tentative scoring breakdown for this programming assignment is:
• 10% calculateWidth is implemented correctly
• 10% calculateHeight is implemented correctly
• 20% calculateDistance is implemented correctly
• 20% calculateArea is implemented correctly
• 20% calculatePerimeter is implemented correctly
• 10% implementation details (manual inspection of your code)
• 10% adequate comments and whitespace (so styling); source includes student name and UCFID
Your grade will be based largely on your program’s ability to compile and produce the exact output expected. Even minor changes (such as capitalization
or punctuation errors) in your output will cause your program’s output to be
marked as incorrect, resulting in point deductions. The same is true of how
you name your functions and their parameters. Please be sure to follow all
requirements carefully and test your program thoroughly.
Additional points will be awarded for style (appropriate commenting and whitespace) and bonus functions in regards to requirements. For example, the graders
might inspect to see if you compartmentalize the user input function to avoid
repeating the same 4 lines per function...
As a general reminder, please do not wait till the last second to read this or
work on the code. It’s easy for life to get in the way and especially important
to get ahead when given the resources. You got this, good luck!
